# Ebola-Virus Phylogeny Tree

**Introduction to Bioinformatics Course final project**
In this project we extracted different ebola-virus species genes.
and based on their distance matrices build some phylogenetic trees 
at the end estimated when was the first ebola-virus back in time

## Java Code

Extraction of ebola-virus species genes based on Marburg-virus genes (Global-Local Alignment).
Calculating edit distance of every two Ebola Species for each gene and saving theme as .CSV files.
UPGMA algorithm is also implemented for testing

## R Code

Phylogeny tree based on following option:
*  Distance matrices of Each gene
*  Distance matrix of global alignment of genomes
*  Combining gene trees
(UPGMA and Neighbor Joining Algorithm were used)
